  ** Using Dynamic Memory 1 **
    
One statistic of interest to many researchers is the median of a set of data. The median is the value in the middle. (This is NOT the average.) Being in the middle implies that the data are in order (sorted). If there are an odd number of data items, the middle is simple to find. If there are an even number of data items, you  take the average of the two middle values.

** Task ** 

Find the median of a set of data from a file of unknown length. 
1.  You need to count the number of items 
2.  Sort the data (you can use the stl sort function here)
3.  Find the median
4.  Output the median

** Restrictions ** 

1. You must use dynamic memory to store the data
2. You must use as little memory as possible
